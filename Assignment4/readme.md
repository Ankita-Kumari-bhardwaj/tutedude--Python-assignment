 tutedude-Python-assignment 4
This repository contains solutions for the Tutedude Python Assignment 4 based on File Handling in Python.
        Tasks Included
Task 1 – Read a File and Handle Errors
File: `Assignment4/Task_1.py`
This program:
1. Tries to open a file named sample.txt
2. Reads and prints each line with a line number
3. Uses a `try-except` block to handle FileNotFoundError
4. Ensures the program does not crash if the file is missing
Concepts Used:  
- File handling (`open` with read mode)  
- `try-except` error handling  
- Using `with` context manager  
- Line-by-line reading  
- `.strip()` for clean output  

 Task 2 – Write, Append, and Read a File
File: `Assignment4/Task2.py`
This program:
1. Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`
2. Takes additional input and appends it to the same file
3. Finally reads the entire file and displays its content
Concepts Used:  
- Writing to a file (`'w'` mode)  
- Appending data (`'a'` mode)  
- Reading whole content (`'r'` mode)  
- User input handling  
- String writing and formatting
